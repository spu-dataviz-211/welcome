## Introduction

<!-- Introducing the class, basic information on this repository -->

You made it! This is our start of a journey for the next few months!

This repository is your guide and orientation of the way we will be doing things in this class! In this repository, we will go over on GitHub, and basic use of python. You can use this place as a guide to find useful links related with this class.

## Concepts & Tools 

<!-- Concepts needs to be covered before getting into class content -->

Things you will need to get yourself familiar with. Following is the stuff you need to be prepared for to fully cooperate on this class.

### Git

<!-- The version control system -->

The assignments are stored and shared using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to be able to version and interact with our repositories.

My recommendation is go over the following stuff.

- Your first steps towards Git, [Learn to use Git](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- Learn GitHub and Git using GitHub Lab, [Github Lab](https://lab.github.com/)
- Useful to understand how Git works, [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
- Useful to understand how GitHub works, [Github Flow](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/-github-flow-cheatsheet.pdf)
- Useful for your README.md files, [Github Flawored Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
- Protips from Data Scientist at GitHub, [Tips, tricks, hacks, and secrets from Alyson La](https://github.blog/2020-04-23-github-protips-tips-tricks-hacks-and-secrets-from-alyson-la/)
- A simple git learning experience with a desktop app, [Git-it (Desktop App)](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)
- A set of tutorials, [Get Git Right by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git)
- Overwhelmed by git command line, what about an app? [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

### SQL

SQL is the heartbeat of your Analytical life! You need to know it to some extend! Following are some links to check out.

- Learn the syntax, [W3Schools SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
- Interactive Online SQL Learning Tool, [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)
- Free class on SQL, [CodeAcademy SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)

### Python

<!-- THe programming language we will be using a lot, a lot. -->

In this course, we use Python. You can use either [standard python](https://www.python.org/), or [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), up to your preference.

It is better to know Python syntax, even tough we will be covering it in the class.

- Learn the syntax, [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
- Online Tool to Learn Python, [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- A rather broader place to learn Python, [Geek for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/)

### Tableau

Tableau Software is an American interactive data visualization software company focused on business intelligence. 

An overview of tableau softwares are as follows:

- Tableau Desktop
- Tableau Prep
- Tableau Online
- Tableau Server

### Development Tools (IDEs)

<!-- VSCode and advantages -->

My favorite, bittersweet tool, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), use it and you'll love it!

Install VSCode to your computer. Add the following extensions as well.
  - [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) a new language server from Microsoft.
  - [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) to enable intellisense, environment management, etc.
  - [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) for getting used to Markdown syntax.
  - [Live Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) to interact with each other.

Even tough are a lot of online resoources available to make the most out of VSCode, recently Microsoft introduced a new set of articles to [learn to code with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn). **Utilize this** to get yourself familiar with VS Code and understand why tools like VS Code are much better than just a text editor.

There are alternatives of course, you are welcome to use those as well. The point is an IDE will make your life much easier if you choose to use one!

Alternatives

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (I use it as an advanced Notepad, rather than an IDE) 
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- And many, many more over [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=integrated+development+editor).

Development tools from your browser!

- [Your instant dev environment in GitHub](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
- [An instant IDE and prototyping tool for rapid web development.](https://codesandbox.io/)

### Code Sharing Platforms (GitHub)

<!-- GitHub in brief -->

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is how people build software. It has over 100 million repositories hosted in its platform as of August 2019, and its an essential tool for collaboration and sharing.

- [Introduction to GitHub, by GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
- [An Introduction to GitHub by US Government!](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-github/)
- [A Dead Simple Intro to GitHub for the Non-Technical](https://medium.com/crowdbotics/a-dead-simple-intro-to-github-for-the-non-technical-f9d56410a856)
  
### Google Colab

Colaboratory is built on top of Jupyter Notebook. 

- [basic_features_overview.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)
- [welcome.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)

## How You Will Do Assignments

We use Github Classroom for assignments. Basically, how it works is described in down.

1. I give you a link.
2. You click on a link, and you are hacked, and I demand for a small randsom!
3. Ignore the second step, you click the link, it will automatically create a repository for you under our GitHub webpage.
4. You download this repository using `git clone https://github.com/..../welcome.git`.
5. You work on the assignment, do a few commits, and `git push` it to GitHub.
6. When you are done with the assignment, you go back to your repository, and **download** it as ZIP, and upload it to the [blackboard](https://saintpeters.blackboard.com/).
7. I read it after the deadline passes, and give you a big `0`.
8. Ignore the 7th step, you will be graded properly.

## Todo List

<!-- A list of items for student to follow -->

1. Create a new issue in this repository using this [link](https://github.com/spu-dataviz-211/welcome/issues/new).
2. Name the issue with your name, like this `I, METIN SENTURK, read and understand the guides`.
2. Copy the following text and paste into the issue message.

    ``` md
    - [x] You will mark things you did in this list, like this one.
    - [ ] Go over on this README file, entirely.
    - [ ] Go over the links in [the things you need to prepared for](#concepts--tools) section.
    - [ ] Review the [commit history](https://github.com/spu-dataviz-211/welcome/commits/main) on this repository.
    - [ ] Go over and **read carefully about how to do and submit your assignments** [section](https://github.com/spu-dataviz-211/welcome#how-you-will-do-assignments).
    - [ ] [Participate](https://github.com/spu-dataviz-211/welcome/issues) in final project discussion!
    ```
3. Tick all checkmarks.
4. As a practice, **download your repository** and **upload it to blackboard** as your first assignment!
5. That's it.
